# qrb_ros_pipeline_manager_service

## Overview

The `qrb_ros_pipeline_manager_service` is a ROS 2 package designed to manage nodes dynamically using a service-based approach. This package allows the starting, stopping, and management of other ROS nodes at runtime, without requiring a complete system restart. It employs a Node Container structure, making it highly flexible and ideal for applications that demand runtime configuration and control.

## Features
- **Node Management**: Load, unload, and control nodes in a ROS 2 environment dynamically.
- **Service-Based**: Easy interaction through ROS 2 services for efficient node lifecycle management.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Pass runtime parameters like topic names and resolutions for better control over node behavior.
